      ACT I


      PROLOGUE

    Two households, both alike in dignity,
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.


      SCENE I. Verona. A public place.

    /Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with
    swords and bucklers/ 

*SAMPSON*

    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

*GREGORY*

    No, for then we should be colliers.

*SAMPSON*

    I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

*GREGORY*

    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

*SAMPSON*

    I strike quickly, being moved.

*GREGORY*

    But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

*SAMPSON*

    A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

*GREGORY*

    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

*SAMPSON*

    A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
    take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

*GREGORY*

    That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
    to the wall.

*SAMPSON*

    True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
    Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
    to the wall.

*GREGORY*

    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.an
*SAMPSON*an
    'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
*   have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
*   maids, and cut off their heads.anaGREGORY*an

   The heads of the maids?an*SAMPSON*an


  Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
*   take it in what sense thou wilt.anGREGORY*an



 They must take it in sense that feel it.anAMPSON*an




Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
*   'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.anEGORY*an





Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
*    adst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
*     o of the house of the Montagues.anPSON*an






 naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.anORY*an







! turn thy back and run?anON*an








 me not.anY*an









arry; I fear thee!an*an

    Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
    After the prompter, for our entrance:
    But let them measure us by what they will;
    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

*ROMEO*

    Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

*MERCUTIO*

    Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

*ROMEO*

    Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
    With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

*MERCUTIO*

    You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
    And soar with them above a common bound.

*ROMEO*

    I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
    Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

*MERCUTIO*

    And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.

*ROMEO*

    Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
    Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

*MERCUTIO*

    If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
    Give me a case to put my visage in:
    A visor for a visor! what care I
    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

*BENVOLIO*

    Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
    But every man betake him to his legs.

*ROMEO*

    A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
    I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

*MERCUTIO*

    Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
    If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

*ROMEO*

    Nay, that's not so.

    Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
    their books,
    But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

    /Retiring/

    /Re-enter JULIET, above/

*JULIET*

    Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
    Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.

*ROMEO*

    It is my soul that calls upon my name:
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    Like softest music to attending ears!

*JULIET*

    Romeo!

*ROMEO*

    My dear?

*JULIET*

    At what o'clock to-morrow
    Shall I send to thee?

*ROMEO*

    At the hour of nine.

*JULIET*

    I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
    I have forgot why I did call thee back.

*ROMEO*

    Let me stand here till thou remember it.

*JULIET*

    I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
    Remembering how I love thy company.

*ROMEO*

    And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
    Forgetting any other home but this.

*JULIET*

    'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
    And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
    Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
    So loving-jealous of his liberty.

*ROMEO*

    I would I were thy bird.

*JULIET*

    Sweet, so would I:
    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
    Good night, good night! parting is such
    sweet sorrow,
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

    /Exit above/

*ROMEO*

    Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
    His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

    Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
    Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

*MERCUTIO*

    And but one word with one of us? couple it with
    something; make it a word and a blow.

*TYBALT*

    You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
    will give me occasion.

*MERCUTIO*

    Could you not take some occasion without giving?

*TYBALT*

    Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

    thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
    discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
    make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!

    But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
    Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
    Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
    Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
    Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
    Romeo is coming.

*Nurse*

    O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
    To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

*ROMEO*

    Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

*Nurse*

    Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

    /Exit/

*ROMEO*

    How well my comfort is revived by this!

*FRIAR LAURENCE*

    Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
    Either be gone before the watch be set,
    Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
    Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
    And he shall signify from time to time
    Every good hap to you that chances here:
    Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

*ROMEO*

    But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
    It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

*CAPULET*

    Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
    That we have had no time to move our daughter:
    Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
    And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.

    No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

    Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

    We shall be short in our provision:
    'Tis now near night.

*CAPULET*

    Tush, I will stir about,
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
    They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
    To County Paris, to prepare him up
    Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

*JULIET*

    Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
    I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
    For I have need of many orisons
    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,

*LADY CAPULET*

    What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

*JULIET*

    No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
    As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
    So please you, let me now be left alone,
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
    In this so sudden business.

*LADY CAPULET*

    Good night:
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

*JULIET*

    Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
    That almost freezes up the heat of life:
    I'll call them back again to comfort me:
    Nurse! What should she do here?
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
    Come, vial.
    What if this mixture do not work at all?
    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
    No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.u

    For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
    And never from this palace of dim night
    Depart again: here, here will I remain
    With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
    Will I set up my everlasting rest,
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
    The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
    Here's to my love!

    /Drinks/

    O true apothecary!
    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

*FRIAR LAURENCE*

    Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

*BALTHASAR*

    Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

*FRIAR LAURENCE*

    Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
    What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
    To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
    It burneth in the Capel's monument.

*BALTHASAR*

    It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
    One that you love.

*FRIAR LAURENCE*

    Who is it?

*BALTHASAR*

    Romeo.

*FRIAR LAURENCE*

    How long hath he been there?

*BALTHASAR*

    Full half an hour.

*FRIAR LAURENCE*

    Go with me to the vault.

*BALTHASAR*

    I dare not, sir
    My master knows not but I am gone hence;
    And fearfully did menace me with death,
    If I did stay to look on his intents.

*FRIAR LAURENCE*

    Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
    O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

*BALTHASAR*

    As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    And that my master slew him.
